      <description>Introduction In the early days of integrated circuits, engineers had to sit down and physically draw transistors and their connections on paper to design them such that it can be fabricated on silicon.
Bigger and complex circuits demanded more engineers, time and other resources and soon enough there was a need to have a better way of designing integrated circuits.
VHDL was soon developed to enhance the design process by allowing engineers to describe functionality of the desired hardware and let automation tools convert that behavior into actual hardware elements like combinational gates and sequential logic.</description>
