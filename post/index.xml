a video and network adapters, sound cards, storage devices, etc. Some custom and special devices, some acquisition boards with ADC, or any other interface might be custom and special devices. Even your modern laptop uses this bus to connect internal devices to the CPU, even without actual physical connectors. This bus is widely available on a different platforms, like x86, arm, mips, riscv.</description>

In other words: Does it appear to at least attempt to present the news in an unbiased manner? Does it have a track record of reporting actual stories, rather than urban myths, conspiracy theories, and other unfounded claims? Does this news source openly publish retractions and corrections after making errors in its reporting?</description>

      <description>Introduction Two kind of books:
Fiction/novels books Non-fiction books textbooks manuals journal articles histories academic studies etc The purpose of reading things like Non-fiction books is to gain, and retain, information finding out what happens — as quickly and easily as possible — is your main goal
NEVER read a non-fiction book or article from beginning to end
Strategy should ALWAYS jump ahead skip around use every available strategy to discover, then to understand and finally to remember what the writer has to say you should be able to read a 300-page book in 06 to 08 hours</description>

      <description>Drucker on Asia - Peter Drucker Feedback: Key to Continuous Learning To know one’s strengths, to know how to improve them, and to know what one cannot do—are the keys to continuous learning. Whenever a Jesuit priest or a Calvinist pastor does anything of significance (for instance, making a key decision)
he is expected to write down what results he anticipates. Nine months later, he then feeds back from the actual results to these anticipations.</description>

      <description>Drucker on Asia - Peter Drucker Knowledge people must take responsibility for their own development and placement In today’s society and organizations, people work increasingly with knowledge, rather than with skill.
Knowledge and skill differ in a fundamental characteristic: skills change very, very slowly. Knowledge, however,changes itself. It makes itself obsolete, and very rapidly. A knowledge worker becomes obsolescent [nerver use] if he or she does not go back to school every three or four years.</description>

      <description>Introduction By asking why multiple times we can have a deeper understanding on the causes of the higher level problem. The goal is to land on a what or a how.
It’s an interrogative technique that’s iterative, and is used to discover the root causes of a problem. The answer to each “why” question leads to an answer that forms the basis of the next question.
The “five” in the name comes from the observation that it often takes about 5 iterations to get to the root cause of a problem.</description>

      <description>Scalar and Vector A net or reg declaration without a range specification is considered 1-bit wide and is a scalar. If a range is specified, then the net or reg becomes a multibit entity known as a vector. wire o_nor; // single bit scalar net wire [7:0] o_flop; // 8-bit vector net reg parity; // single bit scalar variable reg [31:0] addr; // 32 bit vector variable to store address Bit-selects Any bit in a vectored variable can be individually selected and assigned a new value reg [7:0] addr; // 8-bit reg variable [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] addr [0] = 1; // assign 1 to bit 0 of addr addr [3] = 0; // assign 0 to bit 3 of addr addr [8] = 1; // illegal : bit8 does not exist in addr Part-selects A range of contiguous bits can be selected and is known as a part-select constant part-select indexed part-select reg [31:0] addr; addr [23:16] = 8&amp;#39;h23; // bits 23 to 16 will be replaced by the new value &amp;#39;h23 -&amp;gt; constant part-select [&amp;lt;start_bit&amp;gt; +: &amp;lt;width&amp;gt;] // part-select increments from start-bit [&amp;lt;start_bit&amp;gt; -: &amp;lt;width&amp;gt;] // part-select decrements from start-bit module des; reg [31:0] data; int i; initial begin data = 32&amp;#39;hFACE_CAFE; for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 4; i++) begin $display (&amp;#34;data[8*%0d +: 8] = 0x%0h&amp;#34;, i, data[8*i +: 8]); end $display (&amp;#34;data[7:0] = 0x%0h&amp;#34;, data[7:0]); $display (&amp;#34;data[15:8] = 0x%0h&amp;#34;, data[15:8]); $display (&amp;#34;data[23:16] = 0x%0h&amp;#34;, data[23:16]); $display (&amp;#34;data[31:24] = 0x%0h&amp;#34;, data[31:24]); end endmodule Source https://www.</description>

      <description>What values do variables hold ? Almost all data-types can only have one of the four different values as given below except for real and event data types.
Type Meaning 0 represents a logic zero, or a false condition 1 represents a logic one, or a true condition x represents an unknown logic value (can be zero or one) z represents a high-impedance state What does the verilog value-set imply ?</description>

      <description>Operators Unary operators shall appear to the left of their operand Binary operators shall appear between their operands Conditional operators have two separate operators that separate three operands x = ~y; // ~ is a unary operator, and y is the operand x = y | z; // | is a binary operator, where y and z are its operands // If the expression (y &amp;gt; 5) is true, then variable x will get the value in w, else the value in z.</description>

      <description>Introduction A digital element such as a flip-flop can be represented with combinational gates like NAND and NOR The functionality of a flip-flop is achieved by the connection of a certain set of gates in a particular manner How the gates have to be connected is usually figured out by solving K-map from the truth table The truth table is nothing but a table that tells us what inputs combine together to give what values of output Shown in the image below is an electronic circuit that represents a D-flip flop and the corresponding truth table.</description>

      <description>Introduction Shire is a new approach to designing FPGA-accelerated middleboxes that
simplifies development, debugging, and performance tuning by decoupling the tasks of hardware accelerator implementation and software application programming Prerequisites Vivado Intel Quartus RISC-V toolchain Partial Reconfiguration tools Xilinx: MCAP driver Intel Altera Building FPGA image For each board: define the number of RPU Current implementation 256 packets stored in buffer 16 RPU &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Slots = 256/16 = 16 8 RPU &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Slots = 256/8 = 32 Check Makefile on how to swapping PR regions with the desired accelerator For example fpga_src/boards/VCU1525_200g_8G make to build base image make base_0 base_0 is the base image with static regions make PIG_Hash_1 add Pigasus string matching accelerator to the RPUs make PIG_base_2 only update the load balancer to be round robin without changing the RPUs from the base design make PIG_RR_3 merge the first two, meaning taking the RPUs from PIG_Hash_1 and load balancer from PIG_base_2 Adding accelerators accelerators Examples pigasus_sme Ported Pigasus string matcher accelerator hash a hash accelerator for TCP/UDP headers ip_matcher from-scratch firewall accelerator Connect accelerator to RPU use the Verilog interface provided in the accelerator wrapper\ fpga_src/accel/ip_matcher/rtl/accel_wrap_firewall.</description>

      <description>Digital Hardware Design: Two approaches An introduction to FPGAs FPGAs Reconfigurable Mean not defined after manufacture, could be specified by the programmers themselves Configuration types Static Reconfiguration Load the whole bitstream on the FPGA Stop the execution to do the loading Static Partial Reconfiguration Only a portion of the bitstream is loaded on the FPGA Stop the execution to load the partial iage but the wait time is much shorter Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration Part of the FPGA is reconfigured while the rest is still running How is ensure reconfiguration?</description>

      <description>Introduction In the early days of integrated circuits, engineers had to sit down and physically draw transistors and their connections on paper to design them such that it can be fabricated on silicon.
Bigger and complex circuits demanded more engineers, time and other resources and soon enough there was a need to have a better way of designing integrated circuits.
VHDL was soon developed to enhance the design process by allowing engineers to describe functionality of the desired hardware and let automation tools convert that behavior into actual hardware elements like combinational gates and sequential logic.</description>
