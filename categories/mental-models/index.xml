      <description>Drucker on Asia - Peter Drucker Feedback: Key to Continuous Learning To know one’s strengths, to know how to improve them, and to know what one cannot do—are the keys to continuous learning. Whenever a Jesuit priest or a Calvinist pastor does anything of significance (for instance, making a key decision)

A knowledge worker becomes obsolescent [nerver use] if he or she does not go back to school every three or four years.</description>

      <description>Introduction By asking why multiple times we can have a deeper understanding on the causes of the higher level problem. The goal is to land on a what or a how.
It’s an interrogative technique that’s iterative, and is used to discover the root causes of a problem. The answer to each “why” question leads to an answer that forms the basis of the next question.
The “five” in the name comes from the observation that it often takes about 5 iterations to get to the root cause of a problem.</description>
